# 🎉 Welcome to the Juadah Project


## 🧁 Juadah: Online Cake Shop

Juadah is a modern web application designed to serve as an online cake shop. Currently focused on a single store, we plan to expand Juadah into a full-fledged e-commerce platform that can support multiple cake shops in the future.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **TypeScript + SWC**: Provides a type-safe development environment with super-fast compilation using SWC.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable design directly within your HTML.
- **Framer Motion**: An open-source library for creating smooth animations and transitions in React applications.
